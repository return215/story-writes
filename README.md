# Story Writes

Collection of my writing works

## Projects

Here is a list of my planned projects:

### Taffy
  
A boy with interest in electronic music and a peculiar, stretching hand. Idea emerged in 2016.

He is not born with strong physical properties. His weird interest in art often leads him in trouble.

He runs basically everywhere, to any place where no one will ever bother him.

TODO:

- [ ] Import from personal archives
- [ ] idk

### Neo
  
A computer science student sent to the Puyo Pop Fever (2) realm to study the basics of Puyo Puyo and create his custom implementation of Fever mode.

- [ ] Import from personal archives
- [ ] Create overall outline

### Quill

Yet another computer science student who came from the dark side that cost him his voice and hearing. He is attempting to repent his sins by creating code that would be of great help to the people and the world.

### Hydelia

A "limited vision" photographer who appreciates every little detail of life.

This project will be of type "poem".
