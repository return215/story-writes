# Story Writes

Collection of my writing works

## Projects

Here is a list of my planned projects:

### [Taffy](taffy/)
  
Idea emerged in 2016.

A boy with interest in electronic music and a peculiar, stretching hand.  He is
not born with strong physical properties. His weird interest in art often leads
him in trouble. He runs basically everywhere, to any place where no one will
ever bother him.

TODO:

- [x] Import from personal archives
- [ ] Create overall story outline

### [Neo](neo/)
  
A computer science student sent to the Puyo Pop Fever (2) realm to study the
basics of Puyo Puyo and create his custom implementation of Fever mode.

- [x] Import from personal archives
- [ ] Create overall story outline

### [Quill](quill/)

Yet another computer science student who came from the dark side that cost him
his voice and hearing. He is attempting to repent his sins by creating code
that would be of great help to the people and the world.

### [Hydelia](hydelia/)

A "limited vision" photographer who appreciates every little detail of life.
