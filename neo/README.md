# Neo

## Act 1: Node Overdrive

In order to save his study, a student is sent out to Primp Town to do
research and development of the Puyo Puyo Fever mechanics. Neo Hydrocube
(his identity during his study there) encounters oddities beyond his usual
customs. 

## Act 2: Blocks Breached

Neo discovered a weird phenomenon at school. He and his schoolmates saw
objects falling from the sky. Apparently, they are blocks and are able to
destroy things when a line is filled. What are these things? Can the
destruction be avoided before the entire town gets destroyed?
