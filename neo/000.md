# 100: Advisory

Outline:

* Talk about previous semester
* Currently in probation
* Offer to boost grades
* May need to retake some subjects
* Return home, pack up for departure
* Fall asleep in transport

---

I was called by my academic advisor to his room. He said he wants to discuss about my semester's study plan in person. Actually, it's possible to just talk about it by text, email, or call. But he wants to do it like this. For now, let's just roll with it.

NHC: _(knock *3)_

???: "Come in."

I enter the room. 

ALO: "Sit down."

NHC: *(sits down)*

ALO: You may have been aware that your grade is below the institution's standard. At this rate, you may be expelled by the end of the year if you don't improve yourself. Do you have any idea how to do it?

NHC: Yes sir. It appears I have trouble focusing on multiple tasks at once. For this, I have to train myself to split my focus. Then, I seem to have trouble understanding abstract ideas without concrete visuals. Finally, my ignorance of the given tasks and classes contribute to my decline in grades. I failed myself as a student, on purpose. But now that I'm here, I have learned my lesson from the past year.
I can assure you that I will **not** repeat the same mistake again.

ALO: I sure hope you will. Because recently, I have found an offer to aid students like you.

NHC: ??

ALO: You see, the uplink system that you decide to specialize in has developed itself over the last few hundred years. Back then, technology like ours had not been invented yet.

"If you want to move forward, you better move to another place. Right here, this is not a good place to stay. You might return to those old days and repeat your mistakes," my mentor recommends.

"So… do you have any suggestions for a place to live, away from this rough environment?" I ask.

"I do know a friend that might help. But you might need to re-learn some subjects."

"I'll take anything, really."

"Very well, then. Just return to your bed after this. By the time you are awake, you'll already be on your way there."

And he's right. I'm already inside a transport vehicle, specifically a car. The sound of a roaring engine is an evident sign. Also, the seat feels somewhat comfortable.

But there's something weird. I feel like I’m a little bit smaller than usual. And also, why do I have a sense that I am 8 years younger than I should be?

"Oh, Neo. You are awake. We're almost there."

Umm, excuse me? "Neo"? Did the lady in the driver's seat just call me that? I did not remember having a renaming ceremony. Also, who is this lady?

“Dr. Alocaust left something before we left. Maybe you can check them once we’re done unpacking.” The lady speaks again, this time hinting at the bag right next to me.

I rush into the bag and check for contents. Indeed, a document map was already there, along with the usual stuff I bring to school. There's a stationery set, notebooks, personal meds, storage devices, communications unit (phone), and a digital typewriter (laptop).

Speaking of digital, I take my phone from the bag and check the status. No reservation. We must be far out into the country. Oh well.

Having nothing to catch up online, I look outside. There are a few trees out there. Most of the view is just plain grass with a road. The road we're driving on isn't exactly asphalt, more like black dirt. Is this really the place?

“Welcome to [Primp Town](https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Primp_Town)”. That’s what the board says just ahead of us. Never heard of that name before. My speculations of being “far out into the country” is probably accurate. But that was just the welcome sign, so I can’t be so sure.
