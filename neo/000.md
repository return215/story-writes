## Content

Here I am, in front of the dean's office. To be fair, I am kind of nervous.
This is, after all, my first time coming here. Hands are a bit shaky as well.
I may be in big trouble, but not because I am a troublemaker.

My last 2 semester--the first year of my study--has been rough. I did not
perform well in class, not to mention the amount of school work that I
neglected. It's fair to say that my scores are... below standards, going under
GPA 2.0 for two consecutive semesters. My academic advisor could not do
anything to help my situation, so he referred me to the dean's office for
further discussion.

I guess it's time to do this.

(_knock x3_)

"Come in."

Following that signal, I enter the office. In front of me, there is a digital
whiteboard that shows the dean's daily and weekly schedule. To the left, there
is a bookshelf that is pretty much filled with all sorts of books and papers.
By the window is his desk, with a full set of PC. There are two things missing:
the wires and a mouse. I guess he has gone fully keyboard on his system. And
obviously, a couple of seats in front of the desk and the seat that the dean is
on right now.

"Sit down." The dean asked me to do so whilst staring out the window.
Regardless, I obey. I sit on the farthest seat from the window and I drop my 
backpack to the right of me.

```
`ALC`: (_turns seat forward_) "Mr. Adam Nordix, is it not?"  
`NRD`: "Yes, sir."  
`ALC`: "I have seen the reports of your study. It was not really good, was it?
       Please elaborate on the situation."  
```
