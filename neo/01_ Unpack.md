# 01: Unpack

Well, here we are. Primp Town. Probably just an average town you would find in some countries. There is a town hall, library, museum, plaza, and school (we'll get to that one in a few days. One thing that strikes me the most is the repetitive appearance of a round object with eyes. I guess that is some kind of a signature thing in this area.

Also I noticed for a few seconds in the plaza that something is going on. Two people standing behind a board where those round objects fall from above their heads. This time, those round objects which they call "**puyo**" are actually colored. I am still unable to get a grasp on the situation when all of a sudden, gray puyo just drop on one of the two.

"_This looks weird **and** interesting,_" I said to myself, reacting to that view.
